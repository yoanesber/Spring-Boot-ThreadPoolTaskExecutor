# ThreadPoolTaskExecutor in Spring Boot

## üìñ Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of **ThreadPoolTaskExecutor** in a Spring Boot application. It provides **RESTful APIs** to trigger **asynchronous execution** of tasks. The project includes two services:
- **Order Service** ‚Äì Handles order processing asynchronously.
- **Forgot Password Service** ‚Äì Manages forgot password requests asynchronously.


### üîÑ ThreadPoolTaskExecutor Configuration

**ThreadPoolTaskExecutor** is a class provided by Spring Framework to handle **asynchronous tasks** in Spring. It is a powerful asynchronous task execution mechanism that allows you to **manage a pool of worker threads** efficiently. The ThreadPoolTaskExecutor is configured with various properties to optimize performance:  

1. **corePoolSize**
   - **Description**: The number of threads to keep in the pool, even if they are idle.
   - If the number of threads is less than the core, a new thread is created to handle the task.
   - If the number of threads is greater than the core, the task is added to the queue.

2. **maxPoolSize**
   - **Description**: The maximum number of threads to allow in the pool.
   - This limit prevents the thread pool from creating too many threads, which could overwhelm the system.
   - When tasks are submitted, the thread pool starts with corePoolSize threads.
   - If all corePoolSize threads are busy, new tasks are added to the queue.
   - If the queue is full, additional threads are created up to maxPoolSize.
   - Once maxPoolSize is reached, new tasks cannot be executed immediately and are handled based on the rejection policy.

3. **queueCapacity**
   - **Description**: The maximum number of tasks that can be queued.
   - It acts as a buffer that holds tasks waiting to be executed.
   - If all corePoolSize threads are busy, the task goes into the queue (if there is space).
   - If the number of tasks exceeds the queue capacity, additional threads are created up to maxPoolSize.

4. **threadNamePrefix**
   - **Description**: The prefix to use for the names of the threads.

5. **allowCoreThreadTimeout**
   - **Description**: Whether to allow core threads to time out and terminate if no tasks arrive within the keepAliveSeconds time.
   - By default, core threads are always kept alive, but enabling allowCoreThreadTimeOut(true) allows them to be removed when not needed.
   - If allowCoreThreadTimeOut(false), core threads stay alive forever, even if idle.
   - If allowCoreThreadTimeOut(true), core threads are removed if they remain idle for keepAliveSeconds.
   - It only works if keepAliveSeconds is set.
   - This can help reduce resource consumption when the number of tasks is low.

6. **keepAliveSeconds**
   - **Description**: When the number of threads is greater than the core, this is the maximum time that excess idle threads will wait for new tasks before terminating.
   - Controls how long extra threads stay idle before being removed.

7. **rejectedExecutionHandler**
   - **Description**: The handler to use when the executor cannot accept a task.
   - There are four types of RejectedExecutionHandler:
        - AbortPolicy: Throws a RejectedExecutionException.
        - CallerRunsPolicy: Executes the task on the caller's thread.
        - DiscardPolicy: Discards the task silently.
        - DiscardOldestPolicy: Discards the oldest task in the queue and adds the new task.

8. **waitForTasksToCompleteOnShutdown**
   - **Description**: Whether to wait for scheduled tasks to complete on shutdown.

9. **awaitTerminationSeconds**
   - **Description**: The maximum time to wait for the executor to terminate.

#### Example Configuration in `SchedulerConfig.java`
```java
@Configuration
@EnableAsync
public class AsyncConfig implements AsyncConfigurer {
    @Override
    public Executor getAsyncExecutor() {
        ThreadPoolTaskExecutor executor = new ThreadPoolTaskExecutor();
        executor.setCorePoolSize(corePoolSize);
        executor.setMaxPoolSize(maxPoolSize);
        executor.setQueueCapacity(queueCapacity);
        executor.setThreadNamePrefix(threadNamePrefix);
        executor.setAllowCoreThreadTimeOut(allowCoreThreadTimeout);
        executor.setKeepAliveSeconds(keepAliveSeconds);
        executor.setRejectedExecutionHandler(getRejectedExecutionHandler(rejectedExecutionHandler));
        executor.setWaitForTasksToCompleteOnShutdown(waitForTasksToCompleteOnShutdown);
        executor.setAwaitTerminationSeconds(awaitTerminationSeconds);
        executor.initialize();
        return executor;
    }
}
```
